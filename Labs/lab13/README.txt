Hello Mehrdad!

This is the second part of the program, which includes the insert method for the
pairing heap data structure, along with the deleteMin operation which utilizes
the combineSiblings method. I have setup a GUI for testing, as requested.

Please note, I have included the report from part 1 in the report for part 2.
Also, I have changed my program to only print out the options list once, so it
will be printed out at the beginning but not ever again. This was to reduce
confusion while testing.

To make and run the program:

make
./lab

To make and run the program with input from a text file:

make
./lab < inputFileName.txt

Next, the options menu is dislayed:

Options:
1. Insert
2. Delete Min
3. Print
4. Exit
Choice: _

Thanks, and see you next week,

Jay
