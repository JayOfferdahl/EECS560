Hello Mehrdad!

This is the first part of the program, which includes the insert method for the
pairing heap data structure. I have setup a GUI for testing, as requested.

Please note, I have included a preliminary verification in my report. More
testing will occur with the second portion of the lab.

To make and run the program:

make
./lab

Next, the options menu is dislayed:

Options:
1. Insert
2. Delete Min
3. Print
4. Exit
Choice: _

Thanks, and see you next week,

Jay
