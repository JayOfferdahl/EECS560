Hello Mehrdad!

I've included a text file of the output that was required for the last part of
this lab. In order to get the output from what Dr. Kinnersly outlined, just
run the program with standard input from "input.lab8.txt".

I've also included a sample output of running input.lab8.txt with my program, 
which I sent to "output.lab8.txt".

// To view the input file working
make
./lab < input.lab8.txt

// To view the input file working in a text file
make
./lab < input.lab8.txt > output.lab8.txt

Thanks, and see you next week,

Jay
