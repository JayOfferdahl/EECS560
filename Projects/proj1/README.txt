Hello!

Thanks for taking the time to read this file, as it contains important
information about my project. 

To begin, I include all file interaction internally, so there are no command
line arguments necessary.

To run the program:

make
./proj1

These commands will produce all the output that I have outlined in the written
report, however, if you want to add your own commands or testing parameters, 
please follow the following instructions:

To test Fraction operations (ADD, SUB, DIV...etc.) open the proj1.data.txt
file. Add your own commands here (you will see the given commands, as well as
several of my own).

To test external operations (SUM, SORT, MEDIAN...etc.) open the proj1.data2.txt
file. Add you own commands using the following list.

1. Add Fraction to List
	- Takes input as "x x", so to add 1/2, put "1 2"
2. Print List
3. Sum List
4. Sort List
5. Find Mean
6. Find Median
7. Find Mode
8. Reset List

You can see from my examples that several values are added to the list before
performing all the external functions on them. Then the list is reset and I
start over.

As stated in the written report, if you have any questions or troubles, feel
free to contact my by email: jayofferdahl@ku.edu or phone (573) - 673 - 5212.

Thanks!
